Design an algorithm for the following problem: Given a set ofnpoints in the
Cartesian plane, determine whether all of them lie on the same circumference.

'''
1. the line pass through point A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2)
(y - y1) = ((y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1))(x - x1)
'''

'''
2. the midnormal Lm of two point A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2)
2.1 slope of Lab is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
2.2 slope of Lm is -(x2 - x1)/(y2 - y1)
2.3 mid point of A, B  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)
'''

'''
3 cross point of L1 and L2
3.1 L1  y = ax + b
3.2 L1  y = cx + d
3.3 matrix operation
